Minutes and action items.



1. Stateful API services automation (POC) is to generate tokens and login scenario. - Done
2. Inform the tech stack in test automation framework (JAVA, REST API,TestNG,Cucumber). Done
3. Phase 1 targets minimal or low complexity APIs scheduled to deliver 27 services. AI -Team.
4. POC started with Admin Services. AI - 1 - Reporting part required to be enhanced.

5. Test Automation approach legacy vs app-mod API response comparision, the current comparision needed to be enhanced to handle diffrence/addtional attribute on legacy/app-mod side in html report. 
	It was suggested to explore and adapt exiting comparator utility from TR. AI - 2 - Evaluating the TR framework meeting has been scheduled.
6. Externalized complex or large test data instead of using feature file data tables use CSV file or a centralized database. AI - Team.
7. The existing Traffic Replay already captures live QA data from Splunk via REST APIs, saves it to a database. Team should evaluate the existing traffic replay framework to potentially reuse components or adopt the entire framework to reduce effort. AI - Team.

The following items were identified as next steps or tasks to be executed:

1.  Evaluate the existing traffic replay framework to determine if it can be leveraged or adopted to reduce effort in comparison to the current POC framework.
2.  Assign team members to focus on evaluating the existing traffic replay system immediately, while the rest of the team continues the ongoing POC work.
3.  Integrate Comparator Utility used by the traffic replay team to handle complex, large-scale JSON comparison.
4.  Reporting Enhancement look into developing an HTML comparison report for side-by-side visualization of legacy and ap-mod API responses.
